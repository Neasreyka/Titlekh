3
00:01:24,583 --> 00:01:26,208
Mother, do you see how tall I've grown?

4
00:01:26,833 --> 00:01:27,583
Let me see.

5
00:01:27,667 --> 00:01:29,018
- You little brat.
- You're here now.

6
00:01:29,042 --> 00:01:30,000
You're almost as tall as me.

7
00:01:30,042 --> 00:01:31,375
That's right.

8
00:02:36,792 --> 00:02:37,458
He's fine.

9
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,958
He's back.

10
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:40,333
He's all right.

11
00:02:40,417 --> 00:02:42,708
How many liao thieves have
fallen under you today?

12
00:02:45,667 --> 00:02:46,417
Brother!

13
00:02:46,542 --> 00:02:47,768
You are really not afraid of death?

14
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:48,875
As a beggar disciple,

15
00:02:48,917 --> 00:02:50,375
live and die together, of course!

16
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,333
Kid, you have the ability!

17
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:53,938
I, ma dayuan, am not wrong about him.

18
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,542
My woman,

19
00:02:55,917 --> 00:02:56,917
call him brother qiao.

20
00:02:57,417 --> 00:02:58,417
Brother qiao!

21
00:02:58,583 --> 00:02:59,167
Elder xi!

22
00:02:59,292 --> 00:03:00,292
Are you okay?

23
00:03:00,917 --> 00:03:01,917
Yes, I'm fine.

24
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
East 5 south 3.

25
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,500
Five, six, eight.

26
00:03:14,792 --> 00:03:15,792
Gusu.

27
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:56,500
Waiter,

28
00:03:56,542 --> 00:03:57,742
is there any breakfast to eat?

29
00:03:57,792 --> 00:03:58,958
Hurry up and bring us some!

30
00:03:59,167 --> 00:03:59,833
Sure!

31
00:04:00,042 --> 00:04:01,042
Please come with me.

32
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:16,250
Master!

33
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:18,625
What's that in your cage downstairs?

34
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,500
A sacrifice.

35
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:22,167
A livestock, I see.

36
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:26,430
My Buddha is compassionate and does not
abandon all sentient beings.

37
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:29,333
I was passing through dali
when I met a stubborn creature,

38
00:04:29,375 --> 00:04:30,917
it was unruly.

39
00:04:31,417 --> 00:04:35,125
So I took it to see an old friend,

40
00:04:35,167 --> 00:04:37,375
it is a kind of sending it to deliverance.

41
00:04:37,792 --> 00:04:38,792
Take your time.

42
00:04:41,667 --> 00:04:42,458
It's easy to rehabilitate people.

43
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,708
It's hard to help yourself!

44
00:04:45,042 --> 00:04:46,708
Master is a monk,

45
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:48,083
a monk...

46
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:49,792
Speaks of compassion.

47
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:51,625
If you are compassionate.

48
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:54,667
Why do you put a living
human being in a cage?

49
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,750
Hero! I am dali duan yu.

50
00:05:07,792 --> 00:05:09,101
This stinking monk jiu mozhi,
he wants to take me to

51
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:10,958
murong Bo's tomb in gusu as a sacrifice.

52
00:05:30,042 --> 00:05:31,417
I would like to ask you, master,

53
00:05:31,542 --> 00:05:32,833
what is compassion?

54
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:36,292
Compassion and happiness of all beings.

55
00:05:36,417 --> 00:05:38,333
Sorrow plucks the suffering of all beings.

56
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,208
I send him to be redeemed.

57
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,875
Naturally, it is to save
him from suffering.

58
00:05:42,917 --> 00:05:44,208
Forcing a person to be redeemed,

59
00:05:44,292 --> 00:05:45,625
will increase his suffering,

60
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:48,643
how can it be considered compassionate?

61
00:05:48,667 --> 00:05:51,125
Three lifetimes of Karma,
six paths of reincarnation.

62
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:54,417
I am redeeming the caged person,

63
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:58,125
it is to help him to redeem his Karma
and return to reincarnation.

64
00:05:59,542 --> 00:06:01,083
That's not compassionate?

65
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:02,542
The destined person.

66
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:05,583
I met master by chance,

67
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:07,250
it's quite a fate.

68
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:08,958
How about this?

69
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:11,208
This meal

70
00:06:11,792 --> 00:06:12,917
is on me,

71
00:06:13,167 --> 00:06:14,792
but the little brother in the cage

72
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,417
has to stay today.

73
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:21,250
It seems

74
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:23,333
we are not just a casual acquaintance.

75
00:06:23,417 --> 00:06:24,458
Donon

76
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:27,958
you have been waiting here for a long time.

77
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:32,042
I am just passing through here,
having come all the way from tufan.

78
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:34,003
And it wasn't the song
people who were arrested.

79
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:36,583
What does it have to do with you?

80
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:38,143
In the place of the great song dynasty,

81
00:06:38,167 --> 00:06:39,208
anyone who

82
00:06:39,292 --> 00:06:40,601
disregards the morality of Jiang hu.

83
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:41,708
It's all my business!

84
00:06:42,292 --> 00:06:44,375
Too much bad Karma in the world.

85
00:06:45,292 --> 00:06:47,833
Never play with fire.

86
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:51,101
I'm just a man who can't afford
to wear warm clothes,

87
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:52,708
can't get enough to eat.

88
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:54,125
I am not afraid of bad Karma.

89
00:06:55,417 --> 00:06:56,417
As long as

90
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,500
I can look up to the sky without shame,

91
00:06:58,542 --> 00:07:00,333
on the ground, don't let the people down.

92
00:07:00,625 --> 00:07:04,375
The song dynasty is in jeopardy.

93
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:06,250
If you know what's right now,

94
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:08,415
you should go to the border to
deliver the hostages,

95
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:11,375
maybe there is still a chance to survive.

96
00:07:12,292 --> 00:07:13,542
Aren't you afraid of being

97
00:07:13,792 --> 00:07:15,875
surrounded by enemies?

98
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,292
The wrath of all is hard to offend!

99
00:07:20,042 --> 00:07:22,208
I won't offend you if you don't offend me

100
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:27,375
if someone offends me and crosses my line,

101
00:07:28,042 --> 00:07:29,417
I will fight with him,

102
00:07:29,792 --> 00:07:32,333
I will fight as long as he wants,

103
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:34,042
I'll keep on fighting!

104
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:38,333
Then,

105
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:43,000
it depends on your fate today!

106
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:57,542
Dragon claw hand!

107
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:50,768
Branch beats the white chimpanzee?

108
00:09:50,792 --> 00:09:51,912
It is used to beat bastards.

109
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,125
Master came from tubo,

110
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,184
I guess you're not well adapted to
our climate in central plain.

111
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:22,208
After all, the central
plain has a large capacity.

112
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:24,750
Do you want to take a
breath and fight again?

113
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,375
You want to save all the beings in hell,

114
00:11:20,417 --> 00:11:22,458
you must first suffer
the suffering of hell.

115
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:23,917
Until hell is empty,

116
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,958
you will not become a Buddha!

117
00:11:35,042 --> 00:11:37,458
Go to hell!

118
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:17,417
"Eighteen subduing dragon palms".

119
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,583
Master!

120
00:12:42,292 --> 00:12:44,125
You are the master of the beggar gang,

121
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:45,708
qiao feng!

122
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:31,417
What day is it today? Why so many people?

123
00:14:31,792 --> 00:14:32,917
Qiao feng,

124
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:36,042
something big happened to the beggar gang!

125
00:14:38,417 --> 00:14:39,125
Sir,

126
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:41,370
beggar gang and our murong family
has no relationship,

127
00:14:41,417 --> 00:14:42,542
why did you bring us here?

128
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:44,875
I just want you to see,

129
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:48,625
known as the world's first
largest gang of beggars,

130
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:50,292
what is it

131
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:52,917
really like inside!

132
00:14:55,667 --> 00:14:58,708
Within our gang, a
foreign traitor is mixed in.

133
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:00,875
And this traitor

134
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:03,250
is in the high status of the gang.

135
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:06,667
The traitor we are talking about

136
00:15:08,042 --> 00:15:09,042
is you!

137
00:15:09,542 --> 00:15:11,958
What are you talking about?

138
00:15:19,417 --> 00:15:20,417
Elder bai!

139
00:15:20,917 --> 00:15:21,958
What do you want to say?

140
00:15:23,167 --> 00:15:25,000
Vice master ma was killed last night,

141
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,875
he was killed by a traitor.

142
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:29,250
Brother ma was killed?

143
00:15:29,917 --> 00:15:31,042
What happened?

144
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:32,625
Someone testified,

145
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:33,667
it was you who did it!

146
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:34,792
That's ridiculous!

147
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:36,624
I had no enmity with brother ma.

148
00:15:36,625 --> 00:15:38,167
Why would I hurt him?

149
00:15:39,917 --> 00:15:41,333
What happened?

150
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:47,375
Who said that?

151
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:54,333
It was me.

152
00:16:02,167 --> 00:16:03,167
Qiao feng!

153
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:07,375
Why did you kill my husband?

154
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:08,833
Madam!

155
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:11,170
Don't let anyone sow
discord between you and me!

156
00:16:11,917 --> 00:16:14,583
It was my husband who
told me before he died,

157
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:17,000
he said he had a letter

158
00:16:17,542 --> 00:16:20,042
that could reveal your true identity.

159
00:16:20,917 --> 00:16:23,792
He said he was afraid
you would kill him to silence him.

160
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:25,667
He also said

161
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,375
if one day,

162
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:31,208
he really was killed.

163
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:34,583
It must be you who did it!

164
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:37,625
Please, elder bai!

165
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:41,763
Please tell us the contents of the letter.

166
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:44,167
Tell the gang

167
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:46,125
brothers.

168
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:52,625
This man qiao feng

169
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:54,250
is not one of us.

170
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:56,708
His biological parents

171
00:16:57,333 --> 00:16:59,958
died at the hands of the song people.

172
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,500
Another day,

173
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:04,583
that's fine if the son
does not know his origins,

174
00:17:04,792 --> 00:17:05,792
otherwise,

175
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:08,125
not only will the beggar gang
be destroyed by his hand,

176
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:12,542
the central plain wu lin
will also suffer a great calamity.

177
00:17:13,167 --> 00:17:15,208
The matter of passing
on the position of the master

178
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:16,875
involves too much.

179
00:17:17,417 --> 00:17:20,625
Please think twice!

180
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:36,042
Just by this letter?

181
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:38,375
Your murder of vice master ma

182
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:41,000
perhaps still have doubts.

183
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:42,125
But...

184
00:17:42,792 --> 00:17:44,958
You are a khitan!

185
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:47,167
Not only do we have physical evidence,

186
00:17:47,292 --> 00:17:49,167
we also have witnesses!

187
00:17:51,167 --> 00:17:53,042
Here's elder xu!

188
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:57,500
Elder xu!

189
00:18:01,917 --> 00:18:03,250
Thirty years ago,

190
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:05,358
the great men of the central plains

191
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:08,708
led by a leading brother

192
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:10,625
to go to yanmen pass

193
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:13,250
to ambush the khitan soldiers.

194
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:16,625
Master wang was among them.

195
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:17,583
At that time

196
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:21,250
a khitan couple mistakenly
entered the battle,

197
00:18:21,542 --> 00:18:23,250
unfortunately died,

198
00:18:23,417 --> 00:18:26,500
leaving behind a baby in swaddling clothes.

199
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:29,833
This child has grown up,

200
00:18:29,917 --> 00:18:31,500
joined the beggar gang.

201
00:18:31,542 --> 00:18:33,917
He made a great achievement in the war.

202
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:36,875
The master wang then intended to

203
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:39,667
will beggar master's position

204
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:42,042
to him.

205
00:18:42,417 --> 00:18:43,583
This letter

206
00:18:43,667 --> 00:18:47,458
was written by the leader to master wang.

207
00:18:47,667 --> 00:18:49,958
At the end of his life,

208
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,250
he gave this letter to vice master ma.

209
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Qiao feng!

210
00:18:57,458 --> 00:18:58,458
Witness,

211
00:18:59,167 --> 00:19:00,167
physical evidence,

212
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:01,833
solid evidence!

213
00:19:02,417 --> 00:19:04,042
What do you have to say?

214
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:06,292
Elder xu!

215
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:08,667
Take care!

216
00:19:14,458 --> 00:19:15,667
Have you thought about

217
00:19:16,167 --> 00:19:17,083
this letter

218
00:19:17,167 --> 00:19:18,417
could be forged.

219
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:20,417
Elder xu's words is true or not,

220
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:22,500
I will definitely find out.

221
00:19:22,542 --> 00:19:24,917
For the sake of our
beggar's hundred-year foundation,

222
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:26,250
we must first

223
00:19:26,292 --> 00:19:28,167
depose you as the head of the gang,

224
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,125
expel you from the beggar's gang.

225
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:33,208
We will never allow a khitan

226
00:19:33,292 --> 00:19:35,083
continuously be our master.

227
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:36,583
Eight disciples,

228
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:39,042
if you still persist in ignorance,

229
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:41,364
you will be dealt with according to
the rules of the gang!

230
00:19:48,917 --> 00:19:50,208
The four elders,

231
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:52,625
today,

232
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:58,583
indeed to dethrone qiao feng's position
as the leader of the gang?

233
00:19:58,792 --> 00:20:00,583
As a law enforcement elder,

234
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,042
I must remind you

235
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:04,858
according to the rules of the gang,

236
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:08,208
beggar disciples offend
the master of the gang,

237
00:20:08,667 --> 00:20:10,167
no matter what the reason is

238
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:12,958
must be subjected to the sword

239
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:14,750
to offset the crime of disrespect.

240
00:20:16,042 --> 00:20:17,042
On the sword!

241
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:22,125
A great man has no fear of life and death,

242
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:23,833
let alone a mere Dharma sword.

243
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:24,875
I'll go first!

244
00:20:28,292 --> 00:20:29,458
What do you want?

245
00:20:29,542 --> 00:20:30,792
You four elders

246
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,583
are the credit of the beggar's gang.

247
00:20:34,792 --> 00:20:35,708
We are all brothers,

248
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,270
I don't want to fight with each other!

249
00:20:37,917 --> 00:20:39,375
This sword tortured bloody law,

250
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:42,875
I'll take it for you all!

251
00:20:43,917 --> 00:20:45,375
Master!

252
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:51,625
A great man!

253
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,375
Act with integrity and honesty!

254
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,167
Everything is done without shame!

255
00:20:58,542 --> 00:20:59,542
Alright.

256
00:21:04,667 --> 00:21:06,167
From this moment on,

257
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:08,425
I am no longer the
master of the beggar gang!

258
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,375
You listen to me!

259
00:21:15,667 --> 00:21:17,708
All the slander against me today,

260
00:21:18,292 --> 00:21:20,000
I will definitely find out the truth!

261
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:21,708
Don't worry, everyone!

262
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:24,125
As long as I live,
I will never harm our song people!

263
00:21:24,208 --> 00:21:25,333
Not a single life!

264
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:27,083
Take care!

265
00:21:27,917 --> 00:21:28,917
Stop!

266
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:31,833
You killed my husband!

267
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:34,208
You want to get away with it?

268
00:21:34,958 --> 00:21:35,958
Qiao feng!

269
00:21:36,208 --> 00:21:38,458
You are no longer the master of the gang,

270
00:21:40,167 --> 00:21:42,458
then can treat you as a stranger!

271
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:44,667
If I, qiao feng wants to leave,

272
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:46,375
who can stop it?

273
00:21:55,125 --> 00:21:56,833
I think qiao feng is a foolish man!

274
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,125
He has only kung fu,

275
00:21:58,167 --> 00:22:00,292
but by the beggar gang
bullied to this extent.

276
00:22:00,958 --> 00:22:02,208
If it were me,

277
00:22:02,417 --> 00:22:04,917
I would have taught them a lesson!

278
00:22:05,042 --> 00:22:06,042
That's right,

279
00:22:06,083 --> 00:22:07,523
even helped them to block the sword!

280
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:08,750
What a joke!

281
00:22:10,167 --> 00:22:11,167
Azhu,

282
00:22:11,375 --> 00:22:12,375
what do you think?

283
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:18,070
There are a hundred different kinds
of people in the world.

284
00:22:18,417 --> 00:22:19,893
There are people who
bite the hand that feeds them.

285
00:22:19,917 --> 00:22:21,309
There are those who repay
their grievances with virtue.

286
00:22:21,333 --> 00:22:22,768
All of them are only
the heart of the action.

287
00:22:22,792 --> 00:22:24,583
I think qiao feng is not foolish.

288
00:22:24,708 --> 00:22:27,333
He is just seeking a guilt-free heart.

289
00:22:28,708 --> 00:22:30,309
Loyalty and righteousness are not constant.

290
00:22:30,333 --> 00:22:31,792
Heaven and earth are not benevolent.

291
00:22:32,583 --> 00:22:33,667
Since the ancient times,

292
00:22:33,792 --> 00:22:35,768
loyalty and righteousness
have always stood on the throne.

293
00:22:35,792 --> 00:22:38,042
Profit and wealth move the heart.

294
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:39,250
Azhu,

295
00:22:39,708 --> 00:22:40,917
go to Shaolin temple!

296
00:24:05,292 --> 00:24:06,292
Father!

297
00:24:07,083 --> 00:24:08,083
Mother!

298
00:24:12,792 --> 00:24:13,792
Father.

299
00:24:16,792 --> 00:24:18,167
I am qiao feng!

300
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:26,167
Who did it?

301
00:24:37,542 --> 00:24:39,083
I want to know,

302
00:24:39,125 --> 00:24:39,958
who am I?

303
00:24:39,959 --> 00:24:41,542
Feng, you are...

304
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:55,042
Old man qiao,

305
00:24:55,167 --> 00:24:56,607
we've come to harvest the seedlings.

306
00:24:59,875 --> 00:25:00,958
Qiao feng!

307
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:02,792
You killed your parents!

308
00:25:03,083 --> 00:25:04,125
So...

309
00:25:04,292 --> 00:25:06,434
The rumor that you killed
the beggar's gang's ma dayuan

310
00:25:06,458 --> 00:25:07,625
is true!

311
00:25:08,125 --> 00:25:09,667
You are really a khitan bastard!

312
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:11,125
You're worse than a dog or a pig!

313
00:25:11,417 --> 00:25:12,750
If you are capable,

314
00:25:12,875 --> 00:25:14,333
today, you can

315
00:25:14,542 --> 00:25:15,750
kill us both!

316
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,500
I didn't kill anyone!

317
00:25:23,167 --> 00:25:24,750
If I were to kill someone,

318
00:25:26,417 --> 00:25:28,167
would you still be alive?

319
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:47,833
Who really injured you?

320
00:25:47,875 --> 00:25:49,625
Are you serious?

321
00:25:49,875 --> 00:25:51,875
You won't say anything?

322
00:25:58,375 --> 00:26:00,875
The day I was ordained,

323
00:26:02,417 --> 00:26:05,250
I was named by my master.

324
00:26:06,708 --> 00:26:08,458
Xuan ku,

325
00:26:09,125 --> 00:26:11,250
but life...

326
00:26:12,208 --> 00:26:14,625
The sea of suffering is endless!

327
00:26:15,792 --> 00:26:17,333
Icannot

328
00:26:17,583 --> 00:26:20,417
help the one who hurt me,

329
00:26:20,458 --> 00:26:24,125
then there is nothing to say!

330
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:25,875
My little brother!

331
00:26:26,375 --> 00:26:29,125
Why are you suffering like this?

332
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,083
Xuan ku, I...

333
00:26:33,708 --> 00:26:35,417
Don't want

334
00:26:36,042 --> 00:26:39,917
all of you worry about me,

335
00:26:40,583 --> 00:26:42,833
further increase my Karma.

336
00:26:44,083 --> 00:26:45,625
I won't say anything.

337
00:26:45,917 --> 00:26:48,125
I also hope that

338
00:26:49,042 --> 00:26:50,458
that man

339
00:26:52,125 --> 00:26:55,500
could put down the butcher's knife.

340
00:26:56,333 --> 00:26:59,458
And turn back to the shore.

341
00:27:56,292 --> 00:27:57,750
Master!

342
00:28:01,042 --> 00:28:02,958
I, qiao feng, am useless!

343
00:28:04,292 --> 00:28:06,375
Insulting the reputation of Shaolin.

344
00:28:10,833 --> 00:28:12,417
I'm here late at night to see you.

345
00:28:13,125 --> 00:28:15,125
I just want to make one thing clear.

346
00:28:20,583 --> 00:28:22,292
I, qiao feng, am a song man

347
00:28:25,542 --> 00:28:27,250
or a khitan?

348
00:28:46,708 --> 00:28:48,042
Master!

349
00:28:54,792 --> 00:28:55,792
Help!

350
00:28:55,917 --> 00:28:57,083
That man is back again.

351
00:28:57,375 --> 00:28:58,375
Quickly, help!

352
00:28:58,458 --> 00:29:00,375
Help! That man is back again.

353
00:29:24,208 --> 00:29:25,875
- My elder brother
- little bother!

354
00:29:28,625 --> 00:29:30,375
Find him!

355
00:29:31,167 --> 00:29:33,250
Amitabha!

356
00:30:00,583 --> 00:30:01,917
You said I'm back again,

357
00:30:02,125 --> 00:30:02,875
what do you mean?

358
00:30:02,958 --> 00:30:04,208
Have you seen me?

359
00:30:04,625 --> 00:30:06,208
The yijin jing has been stolen.

360
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,542
There's someone in this room.

361
00:30:15,792 --> 00:30:16,458
That's him.

362
00:30:16,542 --> 00:30:18,292
He's the one who killed master xuan ku.

363
00:30:29,417 --> 00:30:30,167
Master!

364
00:30:30,375 --> 00:30:32,667
We went to qiao's house that day
and saw it for ourselves.

365
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:35,167
He was the one who
killed his adoptive parents.

366
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:36,792
You cruelly killed your parents

367
00:30:36,958 --> 00:30:38,583
and your teacher!

368
00:30:38,625 --> 00:30:39,625
Qiao feng!

369
00:30:39,708 --> 00:30:41,518
You are no longer worthy to be
called a human being!

370
00:30:41,542 --> 00:30:44,542
And now you steal the
masterpiece of the temple!

371
00:30:44,583 --> 00:30:45,749
Are you not

372
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:47,917
bullying our Shaolin?

373
00:30:48,167 --> 00:30:49,583
Dear brothers,

374
00:30:49,958 --> 00:30:52,417
I will never hurt anyone in Shaolin!

375
00:30:53,833 --> 00:30:55,208
If you all

376
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:57,083
believe the rumors of Jiang hu,

377
00:31:00,958 --> 00:31:02,458
I have nothing to say!

378
00:31:02,917 --> 00:31:04,750
Everyone in the world says you are.

379
00:31:04,917 --> 00:31:06,042
And you are!

380
00:31:51,625 --> 00:31:53,083
Don't run!

381
00:31:55,625 --> 00:31:56,917
Stop!

382
00:31:59,792 --> 00:32:01,542
Catch him!

383
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Master!

384
00:32:51,083 --> 00:32:53,601
You were injured by Shaolin master
xuan nan's powerful vajra palm

385
00:32:53,625 --> 00:32:55,000
on the heart.

386
00:32:55,125 --> 00:32:56,559
I used my vital energy
to protect your heart.

387
00:32:56,583 --> 00:32:57,958
It saved your life,

388
00:32:58,708 --> 00:33:00,667
otherwise you would have died long ago!

389
00:33:01,708 --> 00:33:02,917
Who are you?

390
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,500
How dare you go to the Shaolin temple
and steal the yijin jing?

391
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,250
I didn't steal it!

392
00:33:07,458 --> 00:33:08,708
I borrowed it!

393
00:33:09,125 --> 00:33:10,917
I'll return it after reading it!

394
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,375
You noble sects are so stubborn.

395
00:33:15,125 --> 00:33:16,625
You always like to wrong people!

396
00:33:18,042 --> 00:33:19,833
Since you think I'm a thief,

397
00:33:20,125 --> 00:33:22,167
then a zhu thanks you for saving my life!

398
00:33:23,042 --> 00:33:24,625
Goodbye!

399
00:34:20,792 --> 00:34:22,250
Steamed buns.

400
00:34:23,625 --> 00:34:25,333
Put on some dry clothes!

401
00:34:28,208 --> 00:34:29,292
Not stolen!

402
00:34:30,583 --> 00:34:31,750
Borrowed!

403
00:34:39,667 --> 00:34:40,833
Your wound,

404
00:34:41,708 --> 00:34:43,500
it's all because of me!

405
00:34:47,125 --> 00:34:48,500
I'll figure it out.

406
00:34:49,083 --> 00:34:50,333
No need.

407
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,083
I'll figure it out myself.

408
00:35:51,458 --> 00:35:52,542
The rain is too heavy.

409
00:35:54,833 --> 00:35:56,292
Really pissed off!

410
00:35:57,833 --> 00:36:00,625
Then, it's all the fault
of this pig-like qiao feng!

411
00:36:00,708 --> 00:36:03,417
He alone has messed up Jiang hu!
It's a mess!

412
00:36:03,708 --> 00:36:04,833
This shitty weather!

413
00:36:04,958 --> 00:36:08,125
We still have to run to the sects
to report the message!

414
00:36:08,167 --> 00:36:09,000
Crazy!

415
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:10,375
That's right!

416
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:13,292
I used to think qiao feng was a hero!

417
00:36:13,333 --> 00:36:15,625
I did not think he was so heartless!

418
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,167
Do you know?

419
00:36:17,333 --> 00:36:18,458
Qiao feng this person,

420
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:19,958
although a very poor character,

421
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,917
his kung fu is very powerful.

422
00:36:22,458 --> 00:36:23,333
Fortunately,

423
00:36:23,458 --> 00:36:26,208
there is still me, bao
qianling, in this jianghu.

424
00:36:26,667 --> 00:36:28,125
In terms of kung fu,

425
00:36:28,167 --> 00:36:30,875
I'm a match for him.

426
00:36:31,292 --> 00:36:32,292
Sometimes,

427
00:36:32,333 --> 00:36:35,125
I can still a little better than him!

428
00:36:36,167 --> 00:36:37,625
If I'm lucky today,

429
00:36:37,667 --> 00:36:39,625
I could meet qiao feng on the road,

430
00:36:39,833 --> 00:36:43,000
see how I will break him into pieces!

431
00:36:43,708 --> 00:36:44,708
Let's go!

432
00:36:45,958 --> 00:36:47,750
Boss! Why aren't you riding a horse today?

433
00:36:48,042 --> 00:36:49,042
Lost!

434
00:36:49,083 --> 00:36:49,917
Lost?

435
00:36:49,958 --> 00:36:51,125
Yep.

436
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,667
Bad luck, right?

437
00:36:52,708 --> 00:36:54,583
Yesterday when I was getting lucky,

438
00:36:54,667 --> 00:36:56,958
I heard that qiao feng killed
someone in Shaolin temple.

439
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,750
Don't you think it's a serious matter?

440
00:36:58,833 --> 00:37:00,833
So, I didn't have time
to turn over my money.

441
00:37:08,542 --> 00:37:10,083
God has opened his eyes!

442
00:37:10,167 --> 00:37:11,917
Today send me a horse!

443
00:37:12,167 --> 00:37:13,917
You can walk behind me.

444
00:37:14,083 --> 00:37:15,167
I'll go on my horse.

445
00:37:15,583 --> 00:37:16,708
Boss, take care.

446
00:37:21,375 --> 00:37:22,458
Boss!

447
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:23,667
Are you okay, boss?

448
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:24,833
Are you okay?

449
00:37:26,792 --> 00:37:29,042
Boss, are you going to ride the horse?

450
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:47,292
Do you believe what they said?

451
00:38:29,833 --> 00:38:31,125
You're saved!

452
00:40:06,875 --> 00:40:08,250
Hero qiao,

453
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:11,458
thank you!

454
00:40:12,042 --> 00:40:13,458
I thought...

455
00:40:13,875 --> 00:40:15,125
I was going to die.

456
00:40:15,208 --> 00:40:16,917
It's not that easy to die.

457
00:40:18,375 --> 00:40:20,292
If you find Dr. Xue, you'll be saved.

458
00:40:20,833 --> 00:40:22,042
But I heard that

459
00:40:22,083 --> 00:40:24,292
Dr. Xue has long disappeared.

460
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:25,833
How did you find him?

461
00:40:25,917 --> 00:40:27,292
You do not remember?

462
00:40:27,958 --> 00:40:29,678
I used to be the head of the beggar's gang,

463
00:40:30,083 --> 00:40:31,750
I of course I have my own way.

464
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Then.

465
00:40:35,167 --> 00:40:36,792
Do you have ways

466
00:40:37,542 --> 00:40:38,917
to give me a bun?

467
00:40:39,083 --> 00:40:40,500
No more buns,

468
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:42,125
take some porridge.

469
00:40:45,333 --> 00:40:46,583
Does it taste good?

470
00:40:49,708 --> 00:40:51,167
Next time,

471
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:53,250
let's eat the bun.

472
00:40:57,583 --> 00:40:58,583
You're right.

473
00:40:59,875 --> 00:41:02,833
Why did you sneak into
Shaolin to steal something?

474
00:41:03,542 --> 00:41:04,667
Actually

475
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,792
I'm a servant girl of the murong family.

476
00:41:07,167 --> 00:41:08,250
My master said

477
00:41:08,333 --> 00:41:09,833
as long as I steal the yijin jing,

478
00:41:10,417 --> 00:41:12,542
he would tell me my origins.

479
00:41:13,292 --> 00:41:14,292
So that

480
00:41:14,333 --> 00:41:16,250
I can see my parents.

481
00:41:16,417 --> 00:41:17,667
But now,

482
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:20,208
with my current injuries,

483
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,417
I'm afraid that

484
00:41:24,042 --> 00:41:26,500
I'll never be able to see
them again in my life.

485
00:41:26,875 --> 00:41:28,625
You will see your parents.

486
00:41:29,667 --> 00:41:31,250
I promise you.

487
00:42:26,958 --> 00:42:28,458
You can't sleep either?

488
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:30,958
Hero qiao,

489
00:42:32,417 --> 00:42:34,083
just call me brother qiao.

490
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:50,917
Brother qiao,

491
00:42:51,167 --> 00:42:53,500
after you send me to Dr. Xue's place,

492
00:42:53,625 --> 00:42:55,417
where are you going?

493
00:42:59,542 --> 00:43:01,375
I'm going to yanmen pass.

494
00:43:02,917 --> 00:43:05,208
You want to find out your origins?

495
00:43:15,208 --> 00:43:16,917
If I'm a khitan,

496
00:43:18,792 --> 00:43:20,667
would you think I'm a bad person?

497
00:43:21,208 --> 00:43:23,167
Whether you're a khitan or not,

498
00:43:23,458 --> 00:43:24,625
in my heart,

499
00:43:24,708 --> 00:43:26,125
you are a good person.

500
00:43:38,375 --> 00:43:41,167
Once upon a time there was a poor family,

501
00:43:43,333 --> 00:43:45,542
the child's father was seriously ill.

502
00:43:49,042 --> 00:43:52,083
So they took all the money they had,

503
00:43:53,542 --> 00:43:55,333
went to find a doctor.

504
00:43:55,625 --> 00:43:57,958
But the doctor was a fraud,

505
00:43:58,125 --> 00:44:00,250
took the money and ignored them.

506
00:44:01,792 --> 00:44:04,542
The money is the life-saving money
of the father's medical treatment.

507
00:44:04,792 --> 00:44:05,875
So,

508
00:44:05,958 --> 00:44:08,250
that kid sneaked into the con man's house,

509
00:44:09,292 --> 00:44:12,167
wanted to get the money back.

510
00:44:13,042 --> 00:44:15,250
But the crook found out,

511
00:44:16,375 --> 00:44:19,292
the kid took a knife out of himself

512
00:44:22,708 --> 00:44:24,833
and killed the crook.

513
00:44:25,958 --> 00:44:28,083
With his blood-stained hands,

514
00:44:28,792 --> 00:44:30,458
he brought back the money.

515
00:44:30,917 --> 00:44:32,917
Do you think the boy went with the knife,

516
00:44:33,458 --> 00:44:35,667
just to get the money back?

517
00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:40,625
Or did he want to kill someone?

518
00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:45,500
If he wanted to kill someone,

519
00:44:46,833 --> 00:44:47,976
would he still be a good person?

520
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,583
I would do the same thing.

521
00:44:54,833 --> 00:44:56,250
He did all this

522
00:44:56,833 --> 00:44:58,833
for the sake of his loved ones.

523
00:45:07,292 --> 00:45:09,250
I'll tell the kid,

524
00:45:10,125 --> 00:45:11,625
in this world,

525
00:45:13,208 --> 00:45:15,042
there's still someone on his side.

526
00:45:19,333 --> 00:45:20,417
Then”.

527
00:45:20,875 --> 00:45:23,333
Please tell him one more thing for me,

528
00:45:25,583 --> 00:45:27,417
thank him for saving me!

529
00:45:34,708 --> 00:45:35,708
Okay.

530
00:46:40,958 --> 00:46:41,958
Today

531
00:46:42,125 --> 00:46:43,875
all heroes

532
00:46:43,917 --> 00:46:45,833
gather at my juxian manor,

533
00:46:46,708 --> 00:46:48,125
working together!

534
00:46:48,167 --> 00:46:50,708
We will eliminate qiao feng

535
00:46:50,750 --> 00:46:52,458
to eliminate the evil in wu lin!

536
00:46:52,583 --> 00:46:53,458
Drink up!

537
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:55,083
Cheers!

538
00:46:55,167 --> 00:46:57,875
Kill qiao feng!

539
00:46:57,958 --> 00:47:00,667
Kill the traitor!

540
00:47:00,708 --> 00:47:02,542
Kill qiao feng!

541
00:47:25,333 --> 00:47:26,625
Master!

542
00:47:30,042 --> 00:47:31,333
Master!

543
00:47:33,208 --> 00:47:34,248
What the hell is going on?

544
00:47:34,375 --> 00:47:35,042
Tell me!

545
00:47:35,375 --> 00:47:36,583
Qiao...

546
00:47:36,917 --> 00:47:37,917
Qiao...

547
00:47:38,167 --> 00:47:40,792
Qiao feng is here!

548
00:48:33,833 --> 00:48:35,667
Qiao, how dare you

549
00:48:36,042 --> 00:48:37,917
to come to you brothers'

550
00:48:38,042 --> 00:48:39,208
juxian manor.

551
00:48:45,417 --> 00:48:46,292
What a coincidence?

552
00:48:46,333 --> 00:48:47,417
We are discussing

553
00:48:47,458 --> 00:48:49,750
how to root outscums like you.

554
00:48:51,250 --> 00:48:53,458
I come here to see divine doctor xue.

555
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:55,542
Amitabha Buddha!

556
00:48:56,458 --> 00:48:57,625
Qiao feng,

557
00:48:58,125 --> 00:49:00,542
do you know that before
brother xuan ku died,

558
00:49:00,625 --> 00:49:02,791
he still hoped that you could
put down the butcher's knife

559
00:49:02,792 --> 00:49:04,625
and return to the shore!

560
00:49:04,833 --> 00:49:06,000
But you,

561
00:49:06,708 --> 00:49:10,333
conspire with a foreign woman
to steal our mastery!

562
00:49:10,583 --> 00:49:13,750
You are corrupting the
reputation of Shaolin!

563
00:49:21,042 --> 00:49:22,292
Qiao feng,

564
00:49:22,792 --> 00:49:24,542
you have no conscience!

565
00:49:24,917 --> 00:49:26,708
You killed my husband!

566
00:49:27,458 --> 00:49:28,458
Today,

567
00:49:28,625 --> 00:49:30,083
even if I have to risk my life,

568
00:49:30,417 --> 00:49:32,500
I want you to pay in blood!

569
00:49:36,167 --> 00:49:37,167
I beg you all,

570
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:38,708
heroes,

571
00:49:39,042 --> 00:49:42,292
must help me to do justice!

572
00:49:42,375 --> 00:49:43,833
Madam ma.

573
00:49:44,042 --> 00:49:47,375
Whether vice master ma was
killed by qiao feng or not,

574
00:49:47,542 --> 00:49:50,042
it is not yet a final decision.

575
00:49:50,583 --> 00:49:53,458
Isn't your behavior a bit out of character?

576
00:49:53,542 --> 00:49:55,902
It's obvious that we're here to
eliminate the traitor today!

577
00:49:56,125 --> 00:49:57,125
But you,

578
00:49:57,208 --> 00:49:59,417
seem to provide support for this qiao feng!

579
00:49:59,458 --> 00:50:00,917
I would like to ask

580
00:50:01,250 --> 00:50:03,125
you beggar gang is not trying to

581
00:50:03,167 --> 00:50:04,833
protect this khitan dog traitor?

582
00:50:04,917 --> 00:50:06,792
This is our beggar's business!

583
00:50:06,958 --> 00:50:08,417
I see who dare to say more?

584
00:50:11,375 --> 00:50:12,708
That's enough!

585
00:50:14,125 --> 00:50:16,667
Why to start a ruckus among ourselves?

586
00:50:16,750 --> 00:50:19,250
Let outsiders see the joke.

587
00:50:24,375 --> 00:50:26,917
Qiao feng pleaded for help from doctor xue.

588
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:32,000
Miss zhu is seriously
injured; It's because of me!

589
00:50:33,708 --> 00:50:35,083
I came here today because of you.

590
00:50:35,250 --> 00:50:36,750
Because under the sky,

591
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,583
you are the only one who can save her!

592
00:50:39,417 --> 00:50:40,500
If you help today,

593
00:50:41,292 --> 00:50:42,542
one day I, oiao feng

594
00:50:43,167 --> 00:50:44,250
will repay you!

595
00:50:48,292 --> 00:50:50,500
Wounded by the powerful vajra palm!

596
00:50:50,750 --> 00:50:53,125
If you hadn't used your
inner strength to keep me alive,

597
00:50:53,292 --> 00:50:55,458
I would not have survived today!

598
00:50:56,833 --> 00:50:58,292
People of the apricot grove,

599
00:50:59,083 --> 00:51:00,083
we should

600
00:51:00,917 --> 00:51:03,250
have kind hands and hearts.

601
00:51:04,250 --> 00:51:06,917
Anyone who asks for
medical help with an illness,

602
00:51:07,208 --> 00:51:09,042
I will not refuse.

603
00:51:09,917 --> 00:51:12,250
Only the people brought by you, qiao feng,

604
00:51:12,542 --> 00:51:14,458
I will not save any of them!

605
00:51:15,542 --> 00:51:17,208
You are a khitan,

606
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:19,375
learned the kung fu of the central plains

607
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:21,292
and used it to kill central plains people!

608
00:51:21,833 --> 00:51:23,417
This is a sin!

609
00:51:23,542 --> 00:51:25,125
How can I tolerate you?

610
00:51:25,458 --> 00:51:26,750
Doctor xue is right!

611
00:51:27,167 --> 00:51:29,333
Kill this khitan traitor!

612
00:51:29,375 --> 00:51:30,792
Kill him!

613
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,958
Everyone here are heroes,

614
00:51:35,708 --> 00:51:38,000
you should distinguish
between right and wrong!

615
00:51:39,458 --> 00:51:41,333
It's me you want to kill!

616
00:51:41,417 --> 00:51:43,083
This girl has nothing to do with it!

617
00:51:43,417 --> 00:51:44,792
Are you going to stay back for

618
00:51:44,833 --> 00:51:47,042
watching this innocent girl die like this?

619
00:51:47,250 --> 00:51:50,708
This is against your
intention to help the world!

620
00:51:50,750 --> 00:51:51,792
Qiao feng!

621
00:51:52,417 --> 00:51:54,417
Since you want to save this girl so much,

622
00:51:54,792 --> 00:51:56,333
today if we ask you to

623
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:58,375
give your life for her,

624
00:51:58,917 --> 00:52:01,542
will you say yes?

625
00:52:02,250 --> 00:52:04,583
It would be my pleasure to

626
00:52:05,292 --> 00:52:07,708
save a close friend of mine with my life.

627
00:52:08,333 --> 00:52:09,625
But...

628
00:52:10,042 --> 00:52:11,268
It depends on whether you're capable of

629
00:52:11,292 --> 00:52:13,083
taking my life away.

630
00:52:13,542 --> 00:52:14,833
Leave your life behind!

631
00:52:14,875 --> 00:52:15,958
Her life,

632
00:52:16,333 --> 00:52:17,708
I'll keep it for you!

633
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Thank you!

634
00:52:28,625 --> 00:52:29,875
Brother qiao,

635
00:52:30,542 --> 00:52:32,167
I don't want to treat the wound.

636
00:52:46,167 --> 00:52:48,917
There are many of my former brothers here.

637
00:52:56,750 --> 00:52:58,917
Today we are enemies, not friends.

638
00:53:01,708 --> 00:53:04,250
The world's heroes say I'm a khitan,

639
00:53:06,583 --> 00:53:08,583
they said I killed my beloved teacher,

640
00:53:09,833 --> 00:53:11,625
my parents,

641
00:53:12,208 --> 00:53:13,583
and some old friends.

642
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,880
If people want to attribute
those crimes to me,

643
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,375
no excuse whatsoever is needed!

644
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:33,083
This bowl is the wine of severance.

645
00:53:33,875 --> 00:53:35,417
Drink it!

646
00:53:36,167 --> 00:53:38,125
We'll write off all past grudges!

647
00:53:38,542 --> 00:53:40,167
You killed me,

648
00:53:40,458 --> 00:53:41,708
it is not ungrateful.

649
00:53:42,333 --> 00:53:43,708
I killed you,

650
00:53:44,292 --> 00:53:45,833
it's not being guilty.

651
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:47,875
Heroes of the world,

652
00:53:49,917 --> 00:53:51,375
this is the evidence!

653
00:53:56,917 --> 00:53:59,000
Any of you want to take my life,

654
00:53:59,083 --> 00:54:00,542
come out and drink with me!

655
00:54:07,667 --> 00:54:09,167
I'll drink!

656
00:54:17,292 --> 00:54:18,500
Qiao feng,

657
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,250
in Jiang hu, the world

658
00:54:20,625 --> 00:54:22,583
everyone thinks you're a hero!

659
00:54:23,042 --> 00:54:24,500
I never thought that today you,

660
00:54:24,792 --> 00:54:26,000
to save a woman,

661
00:54:26,417 --> 00:54:27,875
even sacrificed your life!

662
00:54:30,958 --> 00:54:32,667
My late husband was killed by your hand.

663
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,375
You and I are no longer old friends.

664
00:54:40,875 --> 00:54:42,417
This bowl of wine,

665
00:54:43,083 --> 00:54:44,603
I'll drink it on behalf of my husband.

666
00:54:44,875 --> 00:54:46,250
I'll drink it with you!

667
00:55:07,750 --> 00:55:09,375
The four Buddhist monks

668
00:55:09,667 --> 00:55:11,667
must abide by the precepts of alcohol.

669
00:55:12,375 --> 00:55:15,625
Today I will use tea instead of wine.

670
00:55:17,542 --> 00:55:18,833
Qiao feng,

671
00:55:19,417 --> 00:55:22,500
you have been trained by me
since you were a child in Shaolin.

672
00:55:23,417 --> 00:55:24,667
I didn't expect

673
00:55:24,958 --> 00:55:27,125
today, your fate has come to this!

674
00:55:32,750 --> 00:55:33,917
So be it!

675
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:36,958
Buddha will not accept
those who have no destiny.

676
00:55:38,333 --> 00:55:39,458
Sow this cause,

677
00:55:39,542 --> 00:55:40,833
and reap the fruits.

678
00:55:41,667 --> 00:55:43,587
Everything is created by
the mind alone, master.

679
00:55:46,792 --> 00:55:48,167
Finish this bowl of wine,

680
00:55:51,250 --> 00:55:52,667
will keep my hands off you.

681
00:55:53,333 --> 00:55:54,417
Okay.

682
00:56:06,708 --> 00:56:08,458
Amitabha Buddha.

683
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:09,167
Qiao feng,

684
00:56:09,375 --> 00:56:10,875
our brothers were in guanxi

685
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,101
we almost lost our lives to
a group of xixia soldiers.

686
00:56:13,125 --> 00:56:14,583
Thanks to your rescue.

687
00:56:14,750 --> 00:56:16,375
You are indeed very kind to us.

688
00:56:16,625 --> 00:56:18,083
But in the face of justice,

689
00:56:18,375 --> 00:56:19,250
personal favors

690
00:56:19,375 --> 00:56:20,292
is not worth mentioning.

691
00:56:20,375 --> 00:56:21,375
I, xiang wanghai,

692
00:56:21,667 --> 00:56:23,708
have few people I admire in my life.

693
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,167
I, too, qi liu.

694
00:56:25,292 --> 00:56:26,333
Bottoms up!

695
00:56:34,667 --> 00:56:37,250
Now the beggar gang reward
and punishment is clear,

696
00:56:37,375 --> 00:56:39,333
which is you setting the standard.

697
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:41,792
I respect you!

698
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,667
Within the gang, the army
has been strengthened.

699
00:56:45,833 --> 00:56:47,500
You deserve the credit!

700
00:56:48,125 --> 00:56:49,250
This bowl of wine,

701
00:56:49,917 --> 00:56:51,625
I for the beggar brothers,

702
00:56:52,333 --> 00:56:53,333
to you!

703
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,250
The conspiracy and spying within the gang

704
00:56:56,375 --> 00:56:58,500
thanks to your help!

705
00:56:58,833 --> 00:56:59,833
To you!

706
00:57:01,542 --> 00:57:03,500
Many times to assassinate foreign enemies!

707
00:57:04,292 --> 00:57:06,292
If you hadn't intervened,

708
00:57:06,667 --> 00:57:08,467
our brothers would
have been killed long ago.

709
00:57:09,292 --> 00:57:10,583
To you!

710
00:57:15,292 --> 00:57:16,917
We have fought and killed.

711
00:57:17,083 --> 00:57:18,292
We fought in the battlefield.

712
00:57:19,250 --> 00:57:21,917
We were good brothers
who lived and died together!

713
00:57:22,667 --> 00:57:24,042
Unfortunately, today

714
00:57:24,250 --> 00:57:26,250
someone must die.

715
00:57:27,583 --> 00:57:28,875
To you!

716
00:57:30,417 --> 00:57:32,000
To be able to go through battles with

717
00:57:32,208 --> 00:57:34,417
all of you many times,

718
00:57:36,750 --> 00:57:38,500
is qiao feng's good fortune!

719
00:57:41,792 --> 00:57:43,125
After drinking the wine,

720
00:57:45,292 --> 00:57:47,583
in this life, our
relationship is terminated.

721
00:57:48,083 --> 00:57:49,417
I hope that in the next life,

722
00:57:51,958 --> 00:57:54,750
we can still be good brothers!

723
00:58:03,083 --> 00:58:04,083
Please!

724
00:58:04,167 --> 00:58:05,375
Please!

725
00:58:31,250 --> 00:58:32,250
Boss!

726
00:58:32,333 --> 00:58:36,042
Didn't you always want to kill
qiao feng in pieces?

727
00:58:36,167 --> 00:58:37,875
Now is the chance!

728
00:58:37,958 --> 00:58:39,375
Boss, this is a good opportunity.

729
00:58:46,333 --> 00:58:47,667
Okay.

730
00:58:59,833 --> 00:59:00,833
Qiao feng,

731
00:59:01,250 --> 00:59:02,917
I'll have a drink with you too.

732
00:59:03,208 --> 00:59:05,750
I'll have a breakup
drink with all the heroes!

733
00:59:06,667 --> 00:59:08,250
Who are you?

734
00:59:08,458 --> 00:59:09,792
You are not worth it!

735
00:59:10,792 --> 00:59:11,833
Let me tell you,

736
00:59:11,875 --> 00:59:13,351
I'm drinking this bowl of wine with you,

737
00:59:13,375 --> 00:59:14,958
I am giving you face!

738
00:59:15,958 --> 00:59:17,125
This man...

739
00:59:17,667 --> 00:59:18,667
This man...

740
00:59:18,833 --> 00:59:20,417
Murdered his father and mother!

741
00:59:20,708 --> 00:59:23,583
The khitan traitor who deceived his master
and destroyed his ancestors.

742
00:59:23,667 --> 00:59:24,750
This bowl of wine!

743
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,500
You don't deserve to drink with me!

744
00:59:26,875 --> 00:59:27,917
I'll drink it myself!

745
00:59:28,250 --> 00:59:29,625
Drink it myself!

746
00:59:36,125 --> 00:59:37,333
Khitan traitor!

747
00:59:37,667 --> 00:59:38,958
Take your life!

748
00:59:39,125 --> 00:59:40,458
I'll take your life!

749
00:59:51,958 --> 00:59:53,000
Let's go together!

750
00:59:53,083 --> 00:59:54,167
What are you waiting for?

751
00:59:54,667 --> 00:59:55,750
Beggars' sect members

752
01:00:17,125 --> 01:00:18,125
Turn it over.

753
01:01:30,125 --> 01:01:31,667
I want to kill you, the khitan dog!

754
01:02:04,333 --> 01:02:05,625
Master!

755
01:02:25,458 --> 01:02:26,458
Brother qiao!

756
01:02:53,875 --> 01:02:54,542
Qiao feng,

757
01:02:54,625 --> 01:02:55,500
for the sake of wu lin,

758
01:02:55,542 --> 01:02:56,958
you must die!

759
01:03:20,667 --> 01:03:22,458
"Highlight dragon's shame"!

760
01:03:46,292 --> 01:03:47,417
Disciples of juxian village!

761
01:03:48,042 --> 01:03:49,042
Arrange the formation.

762
01:04:26,625 --> 01:04:27,792
Qiao feng.

763
01:04:27,833 --> 01:04:28,875
Let her pay for,

764
01:04:28,958 --> 01:04:30,500
what you've done.

765
01:05:31,250 --> 01:05:32,250
Azhu.

766
01:06:01,250 --> 01:06:02,750
Go to hell!

767
01:06:05,667 --> 01:06:06,667
Brother qiao!

768
01:06:16,417 --> 01:06:17,542
Brother qiao!

769
01:06:23,542 --> 01:06:24,542
Brother qiao!

770
01:06:25,708 --> 01:06:27,958
You know they'd kill you!

771
01:06:28,250 --> 01:06:30,375
Why did you come here?

772
01:06:32,583 --> 01:06:34,125
I promised to save you.

773
01:06:37,708 --> 01:06:39,125
Was it worth it?

774
01:06:42,042 --> 01:06:43,083
It's worth it.

775
01:06:44,667 --> 01:06:46,208
In this world,

776
01:06:48,750 --> 01:06:50,333
you are the only one,

777
01:06:50,583 --> 01:06:52,125
still trust in me.

778
01:07:24,458 --> 01:07:26,000
"Eighteen subduing dragon palms"?

779
01:07:33,125 --> 01:07:34,292
Brother qiao.

780
01:07:34,750 --> 01:07:37,167
Brother qiao, please go away
and leave me alone!

781
01:07:37,500 --> 01:07:38,667
Brother qiao.

782
01:07:57,917 --> 01:07:59,042
To be a real man means

783
01:07:59,125 --> 01:08:00,583
to be man of men while you're alive,

784
01:08:01,417 --> 01:08:02,833
and soul of souls if you're dead!

785
01:08:03,750 --> 01:08:04,875
Since I'm going to die,

786
01:08:06,417 --> 01:08:08,083
I'll die with you!

787
01:08:08,792 --> 01:08:09,792
Come on!

788
01:08:11,083 --> 01:08:13,792
I've stabbed his oi hui acupoint.

789
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:15,417
He can't use his power anymore!

790
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:17,559
Now is not the time to talk about
the righteousness of the world!

791
01:08:17,583 --> 01:08:19,083
Kill him quickly!

792
01:08:21,375 --> 01:08:22,667
Kill him!

793
01:08:22,750 --> 01:08:25,167
And kill the girl too!

794
01:10:20,417 --> 01:10:23,125
God's will cannot be disobeyed!

795
01:10:27,208 --> 01:10:28,667
Without oiao feng,

796
01:10:29,083 --> 01:10:31,125
I'll see who else can come to your rescue!

797
01:10:35,583 --> 01:10:37,042
Why kill her?

798
01:10:38,917 --> 01:10:41,500
Qiao feng would give up his life for her!

799
01:10:41,583 --> 01:10:43,083
Let me cure her.

800
01:10:43,458 --> 01:10:45,417
Qiao feng must come back.

801
01:11:39,250 --> 01:11:40,333
Father,

802
01:11:44,167 --> 01:11:46,292
I will follow your last wish,

803
01:11:46,583 --> 01:11:48,208
to conceal my light

804
01:11:48,542 --> 01:11:50,292
and endure hardships.

805
01:11:50,750 --> 01:11:52,208
I have finally come to this day.

806
01:11:52,625 --> 01:11:53,958
Today, the song dynasty

807
01:11:54,333 --> 01:11:56,208
is already full of devastation.

808
01:11:56,542 --> 01:11:58,042
As long as

809
01:11:58,250 --> 01:12:00,583
I defeat oiao feng.

810
01:12:01,333 --> 01:12:03,500
It will be the time for our great yan

811
01:12:04,375 --> 01:12:06,750
to raise great justice!

812
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,208
Great yan's sword

813
01:12:23,958 --> 01:12:26,000
has been covered in dust for a long time.

814
01:12:28,333 --> 01:12:30,042
The day it is sheathed,

815
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:32,667
it will be

816
01:12:34,083 --> 01:12:37,292
invincible!

817
01:12:49,208 --> 01:12:50,708
I've recovered!

818
01:12:50,875 --> 01:12:52,500
Let me go!

819
01:12:52,833 --> 01:12:54,833
I saved your life.

820
01:12:54,875 --> 01:12:56,875
When I want you to go,

821
01:12:56,958 --> 01:12:59,167
then you to leave!

822
01:12:59,583 --> 01:13:01,292
Brother qiao must still be alive!

823
01:13:01,458 --> 01:13:03,583
He will definitely come back to save me!

824
01:13:04,917 --> 01:13:06,333
By then,

825
01:13:06,542 --> 01:13:08,375
I'm afraid you'll be
the first one to leave.

826
01:13:08,458 --> 01:13:11,333
I've been helping the world for many years!

827
01:13:11,542 --> 01:13:14,208
How many people I have saved in jianghu?

828
01:13:14,625 --> 01:13:16,292
What have I gained?

829
01:13:16,750 --> 01:13:18,750
They are all hypocrites and villains!

830
01:13:19,208 --> 01:13:21,167
Qiao feng is a villain!

831
01:13:21,542 --> 01:13:24,292
Everyone in wu lin wants to kill him!

832
01:13:24,458 --> 01:13:26,667
But in their hearts they fear him!

833
01:13:26,833 --> 01:13:27,958
Why?

834
01:13:28,125 --> 01:13:30,583
It is because he is
different from all of you!

835
01:13:57,167 --> 01:13:59,333
I knew you were born with a hard life.

836
01:13:59,500 --> 01:14:01,208
You will not die so easily!

837
01:14:01,458 --> 01:14:02,917
There's food on the table.

838
01:14:03,125 --> 01:14:04,375
Suit yourself!

839
01:14:04,583 --> 01:14:06,542
Thank you for saving my life!

840
01:14:06,625 --> 01:14:09,125
If it weren't for your
deep internal strength,

841
01:14:09,333 --> 01:14:11,167
I couldn't save you even if I wanted to!

842
01:14:11,458 --> 01:14:12,750
Do you know

843
01:14:13,083 --> 01:14:14,667
what destiny is?

844
01:14:14,750 --> 01:14:16,583
What can you tell me?

845
01:14:17,125 --> 01:14:18,667
Grudges and strife

846
01:14:19,125 --> 01:14:20,875
is the destiny of the country,

847
01:14:21,208 --> 01:14:22,958
it is the destiny of man.

848
01:14:23,333 --> 01:14:24,583
In Jiang hu,

849
01:14:24,625 --> 01:14:26,425
it is difficult to overcome
love and revenge.

850
01:14:26,667 --> 01:14:28,708
All the causes and
consequences in the world

851
01:14:29,125 --> 01:14:31,833
cannot escape the word love and injustice.

852
01:14:32,333 --> 01:14:33,833
No one is an exception.

853
01:14:33,917 --> 01:14:35,875
Those who have
feelings are all caught in it.

854
01:14:35,958 --> 01:14:39,375
In fact, there is no difference
between life and death and nirvana.

855
01:14:40,583 --> 01:14:42,226
There is no difference between
emotion and non-emotion.

856
01:14:42,250 --> 01:14:43,917
Everything is only the mind, seniors.

857
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:45,083
You are a khitan.

858
01:14:45,125 --> 01:14:48,167
Even gave up your life for a song woman.

859
01:14:48,250 --> 01:14:49,625
Do you know?

860
01:14:50,625 --> 01:14:52,625
The hatred between the song and you

861
01:14:52,667 --> 01:14:54,417
are incompatible with each other.

862
01:14:54,500 --> 01:14:56,375
If you die like this.

863
01:14:56,667 --> 01:14:59,958
How can you face meeting your real parents?

864
01:15:00,583 --> 01:15:03,417
Whether it's the khitan or the song people.

865
01:15:04,625 --> 01:15:06,583
I believe that my biological parents.

866
01:15:06,750 --> 01:15:09,625
They are not the kind of people
who cut off love and justice.

867
01:15:12,708 --> 01:15:14,208
Your father xiao yuanshan,

868
01:15:14,292 --> 01:15:17,708
indeed, he is not a heartless
and unrighteous man.

869
01:15:18,333 --> 01:15:19,958
You know about my real parents?

870
01:15:20,375 --> 01:15:21,750
Who are you?

871
01:15:24,208 --> 01:15:25,875
It doesn't matter who I am!

872
01:15:26,125 --> 01:15:27,750
The most important thing is

873
01:15:27,833 --> 01:15:30,458
you know who you are.

874
01:15:46,292 --> 01:15:47,333
Somebody!

875
01:15:47,542 --> 01:15:49,292
Somebody, open the door!

876
01:15:49,333 --> 01:15:50,458
Hurry up!

877
01:15:51,250 --> 01:15:53,000
That girl hurt me!

878
01:15:53,083 --> 01:15:53,917
She's gone!

879
01:15:53,958 --> 01:15:55,125
Go after her!

880
01:15:57,417 --> 01:15:59,583
And all of you, go after her!

881
01:15:59,917 --> 01:16:00,958
Go after her!

882
01:16:15,042 --> 01:16:17,083
What are you arguing about?

883
01:16:33,875 --> 01:16:35,750
I pay you back for brother qiao.

884
01:16:41,875 --> 01:16:43,167
This is a small injury!

885
01:16:43,250 --> 01:16:44,875
I will heal myself!

886
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:46,375
When I get better,

887
01:16:46,750 --> 01:16:47,958
I'll gather wu lin.

888
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,917
Then I will destroy
you and that khitan dog!

889
01:16:56,417 --> 01:16:58,292
My medical center!

890
01:16:58,583 --> 01:17:00,292
My medicine! My medical center!

891
01:17:00,625 --> 01:17:02,417
My medicine! My medical center!

892
01:17:02,708 --> 01:17:04,042
It's gone!

893
01:17:05,625 --> 01:17:06,625
Sir!

894
01:17:08,792 --> 01:17:09,542
Sir!

895
01:17:09,750 --> 01:17:11,208
A zhu is not dead!

896
01:17:17,417 --> 01:17:19,042
It seems qiao feng

897
01:17:20,833 --> 01:17:23,125
will definitely appear.

898
01:17:52,750 --> 01:17:54,667
It's really south murong,

899
01:17:55,250 --> 01:17:56,833
north oiao feng!

900
01:17:58,458 --> 01:18:00,458
You are gusu murong fu!

901
01:18:01,375 --> 01:18:02,792
A famous family,

902
01:18:03,042 --> 01:18:04,208
attacking from behind!

903
01:18:04,458 --> 01:18:05,583
What do you mean?

904
01:18:05,833 --> 01:18:07,000
Brother qiao!

905
01:18:07,792 --> 01:18:09,208
Your song dynasty,

906
01:18:09,333 --> 01:18:10,792
internal and external troubles.

907
01:18:10,917 --> 01:18:12,292
Value literature over kung fu.

908
01:18:12,500 --> 01:18:14,792
The song people have turned their backs
on you like this!

909
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:16,417
Why don't you and I

910
01:18:16,583 --> 01:18:18,083
join hands together!

911
01:18:18,167 --> 01:18:20,750
How about we work together for the world?

912
01:18:20,833 --> 01:18:22,625
Although I am a man of the world,

913
01:18:23,750 --> 01:18:26,000
what is the right way
and what is the wrong way,

914
01:18:26,417 --> 01:18:28,250
I understand it very well.

915
01:18:29,250 --> 01:18:30,875
You and I have different paths,

916
01:18:31,208 --> 01:18:32,458
we can't work together!

917
01:18:32,750 --> 01:18:34,792
The song people treated you like this,

918
01:18:35,208 --> 01:18:37,125
and you don't hate them at all?

919
01:18:37,708 --> 01:18:39,000
What I hate

920
01:18:39,458 --> 01:18:41,542
are those who stir up unnecessary strife.

921
01:18:41,875 --> 01:18:43,500
Strife in the world

922
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:45,375
are for fame

923
01:18:45,542 --> 01:18:46,708
or for benefits.

924
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:48,792
There is no such thing as unnecessary.

925
01:18:52,500 --> 01:18:53,750
You're here

926
01:18:54,167 --> 01:18:56,208
to look for a zhu, right?

927
01:19:18,125 --> 01:19:19,292
Hurry up!

928
01:19:21,333 --> 01:19:22,333
Hurry up!

929
01:19:23,167 --> 01:19:23,792
Don't play tricks with me!

930
01:19:23,833 --> 01:19:24,875
Keep walking!

931
01:19:26,375 --> 01:19:27,375
Khitan dogs.

932
01:19:27,667 --> 01:19:28,833
Hurry up!

933
01:19:29,583 --> 01:19:30,792
Grandpa!

934
01:19:31,208 --> 01:19:32,667
I can't walk anymore.

935
01:19:33,417 --> 01:19:35,042
I want to drink water.

936
01:19:39,125 --> 01:19:40,125
Hurry up!

937
01:19:40,208 --> 01:19:41,542
Sir!

938
01:19:41,875 --> 01:19:44,083
We've been walking for two days.

939
01:19:44,333 --> 01:19:45,917
Have mercy on us.

940
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:47,625
Give us a drink of water.

941
01:19:51,917 --> 01:19:53,417
Stop!

942
01:19:55,375 --> 01:19:56,917
- You want some water?
- Yes.

943
01:19:57,083 --> 01:19:58,083
You drink first!

944
01:19:58,208 --> 01:20:00,125
- Come on.
- Thanks!

945
01:20:03,583 --> 01:20:04,833
You want to drink water?

946
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:07,042
You khitan dogs.

947
01:20:07,667 --> 01:20:09,500
Aren't you born strong and tough?

948
01:20:09,792 --> 01:20:10,750
Need some water?

949
01:20:10,792 --> 01:20:11,833
Really?

950
01:20:12,583 --> 01:20:13,663
Do you still want to drink?

951
01:20:26,375 --> 01:20:27,917
Do you think we song people can't win?

952
01:20:27,958 --> 01:20:29,125
Down with the song soldiers!

953
01:20:29,750 --> 01:20:31,625
I'll beat you now, you khitan dog!

954
01:20:32,250 --> 01:20:34,130
- Do you dare to battle with us?
- Stop beating!

955
01:20:34,917 --> 01:20:36,375
Khitan dog!

956
01:20:37,625 --> 01:20:40,875
Don't!

957
01:20:40,917 --> 01:20:41,917
Go to hell!

958
01:21:21,875 --> 01:21:23,208
Go home!

959
01:21:30,167 --> 01:21:31,375
If I were a khitan,

960
01:21:31,417 --> 01:21:32,833
would you think I'm a bad person?

961
01:21:32,958 --> 01:21:34,458
Whether you are a khitan or not,

962
01:21:34,542 --> 01:21:36,750
in my heart, you are a good person!

963
01:21:37,042 --> 01:21:38,375
You are a khitan.

964
01:21:38,417 --> 01:21:40,018
Learned the kung fu of the central plains

965
01:21:40,042 --> 01:21:40,917
and used it to kill central plains people!

966
01:21:40,958 --> 01:21:43,059
You are indeed a khitan bastard!
Worse than a dog or a pig!

967
01:21:43,083 --> 01:21:44,434
I will never harm the
song people in my life!

968
01:21:44,458 --> 01:21:45,167
In my single life!

969
01:21:45,168 --> 01:21:47,416
I will never harm our
song people in my life!

970
01:21:47,417 --> 01:21:50,208
Do you think I'm a bad person?

971
01:23:18,125 --> 01:23:19,125
Brother qiao!

972
01:23:38,583 --> 01:23:40,083
I thought...

973
01:23:40,917 --> 01:23:44,208
I thought I'd never see you again!

974
01:23:45,125 --> 01:23:47,958
After I recovered, I
looked for you everywhere!

975
01:23:48,667 --> 01:23:50,875
I've been waiting for
you here for five days!

976
01:23:50,958 --> 01:23:52,042
I was thinking...

977
01:23:52,167 --> 01:23:53,625
I want to wait for you here!

978
01:23:53,667 --> 01:23:55,458
I want to wait for you!

979
01:23:55,500 --> 01:23:57,583
Because I know you're
going to be all right.

980
01:23:57,625 --> 01:23:59,333
You're going to be okay.

981
01:24:08,167 --> 01:24:09,500
From today onwards,

982
01:24:10,375 --> 01:24:12,958
I will no longer be ashamed of the khitan,

983
01:24:13,750 --> 01:24:16,292
and not proud of the song people!

984
01:24:17,917 --> 01:24:19,667
When I find out my origins,

985
01:24:20,167 --> 01:24:21,750
when you see your parents,

986
01:24:22,542 --> 01:24:24,333
I'll quit Jiang hu.

987
01:24:26,042 --> 01:24:27,417
We will go to the countryside.

988
01:24:27,458 --> 01:24:28,792
Grazing cattle and sheep,

989
01:24:31,583 --> 01:24:33,343
never ask about the
world's affairs anymore.

990
01:24:35,708 --> 01:24:36,875
Azhu.

991
01:24:37,875 --> 01:24:39,417
You will come with me!

992
01:24:43,042 --> 01:24:44,708
Whether you're a khitan or not!

993
01:24:45,292 --> 01:24:46,667
When we parted at juxian manor,

994
01:24:47,125 --> 01:24:48,750
I have made up my mind

995
01:24:49,333 --> 01:24:50,500
that for the rest of my life,

996
01:24:51,750 --> 01:24:53,292
I will follow you.

997
01:25:20,333 --> 01:25:21,500
Madam,

998
01:25:21,625 --> 01:25:24,375
doctor xue was burned to death!

999
01:25:24,542 --> 01:25:25,917
Maybe oiao feng,

1000
01:25:26,083 --> 01:25:27,833
he went to save that bitch.

1001
01:25:29,167 --> 01:25:31,083
Qiao feng he's not dead yet!

1002
01:25:31,417 --> 01:25:33,708
If qiao feng is really not dead,

1003
01:25:34,083 --> 01:25:35,583
he find out what if ma dayuan

1004
01:25:35,625 --> 01:25:37,333
died in our hands,

1005
01:25:37,583 --> 01:25:39,583
he will definitely come
back to take revenge.

1006
01:25:39,917 --> 01:25:43,167
But we are also under
the command of the leader.

1007
01:25:43,833 --> 01:25:44,958
How about

1008
01:25:45,583 --> 01:25:47,833
let's go find the leader.

1009
01:25:49,958 --> 01:25:51,708
But he's unpredictable.

1010
01:25:51,917 --> 01:25:53,458
He can't be seen.

1011
01:26:01,250 --> 01:26:02,583
Theleaden

1012
01:26:03,125 --> 01:26:04,208
duan zhengchun,

1013
01:26:04,750 --> 01:26:05,833
he's not in dali,

1014
01:26:06,125 --> 01:26:07,542
he's already here!

1015
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:09,292
In mirror lake.

1016
01:27:07,875 --> 01:27:08,875
Xiaokang,

1017
01:27:09,375 --> 01:27:10,375
it's done!

1018
01:27:10,917 --> 01:27:12,333
You are smart!

1019
01:27:13,250 --> 01:27:15,083
This time duan zhengchun

1020
01:27:15,458 --> 01:27:16,458
he is

1021
01:27:16,708 --> 01:27:18,292
surely will die!

1022
01:27:19,417 --> 01:27:20,417
But...

1023
01:27:21,750 --> 01:27:22,958
Are you really willing to

1024
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:24,250
let him die?

1025
01:27:27,833 --> 01:27:30,042
Those men who have wronged me!

1026
01:27:30,500 --> 01:27:31,500
Die...

1027
01:27:31,875 --> 01:27:33,542
It's all cheap for them!

1028
01:27:37,333 --> 01:27:38,917
I, bai shijing,

1029
01:27:39,708 --> 01:27:41,167
will never fail you!

1030
01:27:41,667 --> 01:27:43,042
Are you afraid?

1031
01:27:45,875 --> 01:27:47,375
Don't be afraid.

1032
01:27:50,500 --> 01:27:52,083
Even if you die

1033
01:27:53,958 --> 01:27:55,708
I will let you die

1034
01:27:56,125 --> 01:27:59,167
comfortably.

1035
01:28:54,458 --> 01:28:55,750
Why don't you let me kill him?

1036
01:28:57,583 --> 01:28:58,583
Your highness!

1037
01:29:10,667 --> 01:29:11,667
Azi!

1038
01:29:12,625 --> 01:29:13,625
Azi!

1039
01:29:14,292 --> 01:29:16,125
She is your own daughter!

1040
01:29:17,833 --> 01:29:19,042
This golden lock!

1041
01:29:19,167 --> 01:29:21,000
You put it on with your
own hands back then!

1042
01:29:21,417 --> 01:29:22,934
It's engraved with a bamboo character.

1043
01:29:22,958 --> 01:29:24,208
You don't remember, do you?

1044
01:29:24,417 --> 01:29:25,500
She is my daughter?

1045
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:28,059
I came back this time because I wanted

1046
01:29:28,083 --> 01:29:29,125
I don't have a father!

1047
01:29:31,458 --> 01:29:32,833
Since I was a child,

1048
01:29:32,875 --> 01:29:33,917
I've been alone.

1049
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:36,760
Since you abandoned
me so cruelly back then,

1050
01:29:36,833 --> 01:29:38,393
never expect me to recognize you again!

1051
01:29:42,375 --> 01:29:43,500
Give it back to you!

1052
01:29:47,167 --> 01:29:48,527
You don't deserve to be my father!

1053
01:30:18,333 --> 01:30:20,000
Thank you for saving me!

1054
01:30:20,125 --> 01:30:21,125
No need to say thank you!

1055
01:30:21,250 --> 01:30:23,500
I just don't like those side ways

1056
01:30:23,708 --> 01:30:25,167
which they hurt people.

1057
01:30:26,500 --> 01:30:27,875
Heroic and chivalrous!

1058
01:30:28,083 --> 01:30:30,292
Why did you come to mirror lake?

1059
01:30:35,292 --> 01:30:36,500
Are you duan zhengchun?

1060
01:30:36,750 --> 01:30:37,833
I am.

1061
01:30:40,333 --> 01:30:41,375
I am qiao feng.

1062
01:30:42,792 --> 01:30:44,208
I was just coming to find you!

1063
01:30:44,792 --> 01:30:46,152
You are qiao feng, the great hero?

1064
01:30:46,417 --> 01:30:47,667
I know that my son duan yu

1065
01:30:47,708 --> 01:30:49,083
and you are brothers!

1066
01:30:49,125 --> 01:30:50,500
I've always wanted to meet you!

1067
01:30:51,875 --> 01:30:53,208
My son is naughty.

1068
01:30:53,625 --> 01:30:56,917
He's locked up in the temple
in front of the mountain to meditate.

1069
01:30:57,250 --> 01:30:58,667
Today is god's will.

1070
01:30:59,833 --> 01:31:00,833
Yes!

1071
01:31:01,667 --> 01:31:02,875
It is the will of god!

1072
01:31:03,417 --> 01:31:04,375
In that case,

1073
01:31:04,417 --> 01:31:05,667
then, I invite you two

1074
01:31:06,250 --> 01:31:08,450
to come to the mirror lake courtyard
for a get-together.

1075
01:31:11,250 --> 01:31:12,750
I'll come see you tonight.

1076
01:31:13,458 --> 01:31:14,458
Good.

1077
01:31:21,333 --> 01:31:23,213
Your highness has not
shown up for a long time.

1078
01:31:23,708 --> 01:31:24,875
You're here this time.

1079
01:31:25,125 --> 01:31:26,375
What do you want?

1080
01:31:28,417 --> 01:31:29,583
I want to see you.

1081
01:31:32,417 --> 01:31:34,083
Although I am not here,

1082
01:31:34,250 --> 01:31:36,583
you are always on my mind

1083
01:31:40,917 --> 01:31:43,042
do you really think

1084
01:31:43,083 --> 01:31:45,000
I don't know how many
women you have out there?

1085
01:31:46,333 --> 01:31:48,583
How can you believe
the rumors of the world?

1086
01:31:49,708 --> 01:31:51,000
Just like qiao feng,

1087
01:31:51,625 --> 01:31:54,458
everyone in the world says he's a villain.

1088
01:31:54,667 --> 01:31:56,500
But I believe he is loyal and righteous.

1089
01:31:56,625 --> 01:31:58,601
He's not the kind of person
who would do such things.

1090
01:31:58,625 --> 01:31:59,958
I'm just like him.

1091
01:32:00,458 --> 01:32:02,542
I never care what people outside say.

1092
01:32:05,042 --> 01:32:06,500
I just hope that

1093
01:32:07,333 --> 01:32:09,000
people around me

1094
01:32:09,500 --> 01:32:11,208
can understand me completely.

1095
01:32:12,125 --> 01:32:13,667
Just give me a chance

1096
01:32:13,750 --> 01:32:15,500
to take you and zi back to dali.

1097
01:32:15,875 --> 01:32:18,167
Let me be a good father, a good husband!

1098
01:32:18,708 --> 01:32:20,083
Let's reunite as a family!

1099
01:32:21,792 --> 01:32:23,208
What family reunion?

1100
01:32:26,583 --> 01:32:27,875
Don't you know that a zi,

1101
01:32:27,917 --> 01:32:29,167
she has a sister?

1102
01:32:29,208 --> 01:32:29,958
Sister?

1103
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:31,000
Where is she?

1104
01:32:31,250 --> 01:32:32,708
I gave her to someone else.

1105
01:32:34,125 --> 01:32:34,833
Why did you do that?

1106
01:32:34,875 --> 01:32:36,333
Why did I do it?

1107
01:32:36,833 --> 01:32:37,833
Your highness,

1108
01:32:37,917 --> 01:32:39,917
you have so many concubines, so many women.

1109
01:32:39,958 --> 01:32:40,875
So many children!

1110
01:32:40,917 --> 01:32:42,625
Do you care about her?

1111
01:32:43,375 --> 01:32:44,975
I deliberately gave her to someone else!

1112
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:46,393
So that she would hate you
for the rest of her life!

1113
01:32:46,417 --> 01:32:47,601
Even if she kills you with her own hands.

1114
01:32:47,625 --> 01:32:49,025
I think it's the right thing to do.

1115
01:32:51,958 --> 01:32:52,958
Get off!

1116
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:08,000
Azi!

1117
01:33:08,083 --> 01:33:10,101
You're not really going to
kill your father, are you?

1118
01:33:10,125 --> 01:33:11,291
You just said

1119
01:33:11,292 --> 01:33:12,250
if I kill him,

1120
01:33:12,292 --> 01:33:13,458
he deserved it anyway.

1121
01:33:13,583 --> 01:33:15,000
He doesn't deserve to die now!

1122
01:33:15,167 --> 01:33:16,184
I know you're doing it for my own good!

1123
01:33:16,208 --> 01:33:16,917
No need to scold my daughter.

1124
01:33:16,958 --> 01:33:17,708
Shut up!

1125
01:33:17,833 --> 01:33:18,542
Zi!

1126
01:33:18,750 --> 01:33:19,958
It's all my fault!

1127
01:33:20,042 --> 01:33:21,042
Don't fight!

1128
01:33:34,917 --> 01:33:36,625
What are you doing sneaking around?

1129
01:33:39,375 --> 01:33:41,250
You are a friend of hero qiao!

1130
01:33:46,958 --> 01:33:48,583
The things you threw away,

1131
01:33:49,417 --> 01:33:51,208
now we found it.

1132
01:33:55,958 --> 01:33:56,958
Thank you!

1133
01:34:00,875 --> 01:34:02,125
Anything else?

1134
01:34:16,292 --> 01:34:17,375
Your daughter

1135
01:34:18,417 --> 01:34:19,750
loves you.

1136
01:34:21,958 --> 01:34:23,000
I know that,

1137
01:34:23,917 --> 01:34:25,125
as a father

1138
01:34:25,625 --> 01:34:27,375
I also love my daughter very much!

1139
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:02,125
Azhu.

1140
01:35:06,792 --> 01:35:08,583
You come to drink with me tonight!

1141
01:35:27,208 --> 01:35:28,208
Brother qiao,

1142
01:35:29,708 --> 01:35:30,792
why?

1143
01:35:31,208 --> 01:35:32,792
You did not do it today?

1144
01:35:33,875 --> 01:35:35,500
I have to see someone else.

1145
01:35:41,167 --> 01:35:42,417
Brother qiao.

1146
01:35:44,792 --> 01:35:46,250
To know you,

1147
01:35:47,583 --> 01:35:49,833
to experience so many things with you,

1148
01:35:52,583 --> 01:35:54,333
in my life

1149
01:35:55,625 --> 01:35:57,208
I feel the most happy.

1150
01:36:02,083 --> 01:36:03,083
So...

1151
01:36:03,750 --> 01:36:05,042
No matter what

1152
01:36:06,125 --> 01:36:09,083
I hope you can get rid
of the knot in your heart.

1153
01:36:12,958 --> 01:36:14,042
After tonight

1154
01:36:14,792 --> 01:36:16,292
I'll take you to the border.

1155
01:36:17,667 --> 01:36:18,667
Okay?

1156
01:36:22,750 --> 01:36:23,750
Yes.

1157
01:36:24,292 --> 01:36:25,625
In the border

1158
01:36:26,458 --> 01:36:27,583
I herd cattle

1159
01:36:28,167 --> 01:36:29,333
you herd the sheep

1160
01:36:30,583 --> 01:36:32,083
carefreely and happily

1161
01:36:33,083 --> 01:36:34,458
live out the rest of our lives.

1162
01:37:04,375 --> 01:37:05,375
Brother qiao,

1163
01:37:06,708 --> 01:37:08,000
why are you here?

1164
01:37:15,833 --> 01:37:16,958
Little brother duan,

1165
01:37:17,750 --> 01:37:20,917
your father, duan zheng chun,
is the one who killed my parents,

1166
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,917
I'm going to end it with him tonight.

1167
01:37:26,750 --> 01:37:28,167
I treat you as a brother.

1168
01:37:28,833 --> 01:37:30,518
For the sake of friendship
and righteousness,

1169
01:37:30,542 --> 01:37:32,542
I have to tell you in person.

1170
01:37:34,125 --> 01:37:35,125
After tonight,

1171
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:37,375
you take revenge for your father,

1172
01:37:38,542 --> 01:37:39,875
I will not run away.

1173
01:37:47,958 --> 01:37:48,958
Master!

1174
01:37:49,167 --> 01:37:50,167
Master!

1175
01:37:51,042 --> 01:37:52,125
I'm xu zhu,

1176
01:37:52,292 --> 01:37:53,583
saw your hostile energy.

1177
01:37:53,958 --> 01:37:55,417
I would like to advise you that

1178
01:37:55,667 --> 01:37:56,792
one thought becomes Buddha,

1179
01:37:56,833 --> 01:37:58,073
one thought leads to the devil!

1180
01:38:16,875 --> 01:38:17,875
Hero qiao.

1181
01:38:24,125 --> 01:38:25,208
Duan zhengchun,

1182
01:38:25,750 --> 01:38:26,750
where's a zhu?

1183
01:38:27,333 --> 01:38:28,458
She's fine.

1184
01:38:29,958 --> 01:38:31,958
I know what you're here for today.

1185
01:38:32,333 --> 01:38:33,333
That's right.

1186
01:38:34,042 --> 01:38:36,583
The bloodshed at yanmen pass 30 years ago.

1187
01:38:37,125 --> 01:38:38,125
Admit it or not,

1188
01:38:38,458 --> 01:38:40,375
you were the leader.

1189
01:38:41,292 --> 01:38:43,333
It was my fault back then.

1190
01:38:45,083 --> 01:38:47,125
I just reunited with my daughter.

1191
01:38:48,333 --> 01:38:50,458
I don't want her to lose her loved ones.

1192
01:38:52,458 --> 01:38:53,708
I beg you!

1193
01:38:54,583 --> 01:38:56,708
Can you let go of this grudge?

1194
01:38:57,167 --> 01:38:59,417
When you killed my parents,

1195
01:39:00,708 --> 01:39:02,458
I lost a loved one.

1196
01:39:02,583 --> 01:39:03,917
What about that?

1197
01:39:04,458 --> 01:39:05,667
Thirty years later

1198
01:39:05,792 --> 01:39:07,250
you have caused the whole jianghu

1199
01:39:07,417 --> 01:39:08,792
a bloody mess!

1200
01:39:09,333 --> 01:39:10,625
The sins you sowed,

1201
01:39:10,792 --> 01:39:12,417
you have to pay back!

1202
01:40:14,292 --> 01:40:15,667
How can it be you?

1203
01:40:18,625 --> 01:40:20,000
Brother qiao.

1204
01:40:22,208 --> 01:40:23,750
I'm sorry.

1205
01:40:27,125 --> 01:40:28,750
I can't

1206
01:40:29,625 --> 01:40:32,417
let you kill duan zhengchun!

1207
01:40:36,208 --> 01:40:37,500
It is because

1208
01:40:39,333 --> 01:40:41,542
he's my father!

1209
01:40:43,792 --> 01:40:45,042
You're so silly!

1210
01:40:51,917 --> 01:40:53,333
Brother qiao,

1211
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:56,208
my life

1212
01:40:57,333 --> 01:40:59,833
was originally saved by you!

1213
01:41:02,458 --> 01:41:04,917
So don't blame yourself.

1214
01:41:06,250 --> 01:41:08,125
You're so silly!

1215
01:41:10,250 --> 01:41:12,750
To die in your arms.

1216
01:41:15,833 --> 01:41:17,375
This life,

1217
01:41:20,375 --> 01:41:22,792
I have no regrets!

1218
01:41:23,333 --> 01:41:25,458
It's my fault!

1219
01:41:30,500 --> 01:41:32,375
Brother qiao...

1220
01:41:35,875 --> 01:41:37,292
Will you still

1221
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,875
take me to seaside?

1222
01:41:43,125 --> 01:41:44,125
Yes.

1223
01:41:46,458 --> 01:41:47,750
I will...

1224
01:43:21,875 --> 01:43:24,792
I don't want to do this to her.

1225
01:43:26,667 --> 01:43:28,250
Azhu!

1226
01:43:36,208 --> 01:43:37,375
Thirty years ago,

1227
01:43:38,250 --> 01:43:39,542
I've been in dali.

1228
01:43:40,125 --> 01:43:41,875
I've never been to yanmen pass.

1229
01:43:46,500 --> 01:43:48,750
As for the letter you mentioned,

1230
01:43:51,958 --> 01:43:53,250
I didn't write it!

1231
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,583
Also, I'm not the
leader you're looking for!

1232
01:44:06,208 --> 01:44:07,667
I really don't understand

1233
01:44:09,250 --> 01:44:11,625
why they would use you to kill me?

1234
01:45:10,542 --> 01:45:11,542
Bai shijing!

1235
01:45:12,792 --> 01:45:14,208
Branch beats the white chimpanzee,

1236
01:45:14,792 --> 01:45:16,500
it is a powerful object!

1237
01:45:17,667 --> 01:45:21,792
It should choose a
wise master to live with.

1238
01:45:23,125 --> 01:45:24,000
Beggar gang

1239
01:45:24,083 --> 01:45:26,000
is the largest gang in the world,

1240
01:45:26,250 --> 01:45:28,667
but serving for the weakened song dynasty!

1241
01:45:28,875 --> 01:45:30,375
Mr. Murong said

1242
01:45:30,417 --> 01:45:31,542
great song

1243
01:45:32,042 --> 01:45:34,208
if they fought with dali,

1244
01:45:34,333 --> 01:45:36,583
the world will be in chaos!

1245
01:45:37,083 --> 01:45:38,667
The world will be in chaos!

1246
01:45:39,375 --> 01:45:40,375
If there is chaos,

1247
01:45:40,750 --> 01:45:42,500
only then we can rise to power!

1248
01:45:44,417 --> 01:45:47,083
So you used me to kill duan zhengchun!

1249
01:45:47,250 --> 01:45:48,434
From the beginning to the end,

1250
01:45:48,458 --> 01:45:50,375
it's always you and kang min.

1251
01:45:50,667 --> 01:45:52,625
Murong fu was behind it,

1252
01:45:52,667 --> 01:45:53,958
conspiring to cause chaos!

1253
01:45:55,292 --> 01:45:57,792
The world is full of
shameless people like you!

1254
01:45:58,625 --> 01:46:00,458
That's why there's so much chaos!

1255
01:46:05,292 --> 01:46:07,250
Does she the one who killed my sister?

1256
01:46:09,625 --> 01:46:10,625
Kang min,

1257
01:46:11,333 --> 01:46:12,973
how can you live up to the beggar's gang?

1258
01:46:13,250 --> 01:46:14,750
How can you live up to brother ma?

1259
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:16,417
Ma dayuan?

1260
01:46:17,500 --> 01:46:19,917
He snatched me back when I was 14!

1261
01:46:21,583 --> 01:46:22,875
My whole life

1262
01:46:23,167 --> 01:46:25,917
ls ruined in the hands
of you beggar gang men!

1263
01:46:26,833 --> 01:46:28,553
But I, kang min, am not willing to give up!

1264
01:46:30,500 --> 01:46:32,458
I want all men in the world

1265
01:46:33,458 --> 01:46:35,583
to bow and scrape to me.

1266
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:37,500
As long as I, kang min

1267
01:46:37,583 --> 01:46:39,042
what I can't get,

1268
01:46:40,417 --> 01:46:42,583
I can't let anyone else get it either!

1269
01:46:43,958 --> 01:46:45,518
What makes you think
that all men in the world

1270
01:46:45,542 --> 01:46:46,792
will listen to you?

1271
01:46:48,417 --> 01:46:50,250
My beautiful face.

1272
01:46:51,083 --> 01:46:53,083
All men in the world except oiao feng,

1273
01:46:53,792 --> 01:46:55,125
all men

1274
01:46:55,833 --> 01:46:58,208
can fall under my skirt!

1275
01:46:58,625 --> 01:47:01,292
Even your father is the same!

1276
01:47:05,708 --> 01:47:06,958
Your face,

1277
01:47:07,042 --> 01:47:08,542
it's really pretty!

1278
01:47:32,500 --> 01:47:33,833
My face!

1279
01:47:45,375 --> 01:47:46,583
Elder bai,

1280
01:47:46,667 --> 01:47:48,208
qiao feng has arrived!

1281
01:47:48,417 --> 01:47:49,375
Thank you!

1282
01:47:49,417 --> 01:47:50,857
You've accomplished all your merits!

1283
01:47:56,167 --> 01:47:57,500
Mr. Murong,

1284
01:47:58,292 --> 01:47:59,792
kill oiao feng!

1285
01:48:00,375 --> 01:48:02,542
We'll share the world!

1286
01:49:13,583 --> 01:49:14,583
Murong fu.

1287
01:49:14,917 --> 01:49:16,557
You are finally willing to show yourself!

1288
01:49:17,458 --> 01:49:19,583
Today we must settle all grudges!

1289
01:49:19,750 --> 01:49:21,542
Today is the day that the great yan

1290
01:49:21,583 --> 01:49:23,083
is restored!

1291
01:49:23,917 --> 01:49:25,000
Either

1292
01:49:25,500 --> 01:49:27,917
be a meritorious servant
of the great yan kingdom,

1293
01:49:28,167 --> 01:49:29,292
of,

1294
01:49:29,542 --> 01:49:31,583
be a dead soldier of your song denasty!

1295
01:49:31,750 --> 01:49:34,208
If you don't surrender,

1296
01:49:34,750 --> 01:49:36,833
I will let you die here!

1297
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:38,625
Come and get it if you dare!

1298
01:49:39,583 --> 01:49:40,583
What are you waiting for?

1299
01:49:43,417 --> 01:49:44,417
Scumbag!

1300
01:49:44,458 --> 01:49:45,583
Look at your hand!

1301
01:50:36,375 --> 01:50:37,375
You're not leaving yet?

1302
01:50:37,667 --> 01:50:38,667
I'm not leaving!

1303
01:50:39,042 --> 01:50:40,417
It's none of your business here!

1304
01:50:40,917 --> 01:50:42,000
Go home!

1305
01:50:44,833 --> 01:50:46,042
I'm here to help you!

1306
01:50:46,458 --> 01:50:47,750
I took my father's sword.

1307
01:50:48,083 --> 01:50:49,083
Here.

1308
01:52:40,250 --> 01:52:42,333
I didn't expect a khitan,

1309
01:52:42,708 --> 01:52:44,792
use the broken sword of dali,

1310
01:52:45,083 --> 01:52:48,042
to protect the broken song dynasty!

1311
01:52:49,250 --> 01:52:50,583
Can you protect it?

1312
01:52:50,792 --> 01:52:52,000
I am defending

1313
01:52:52,125 --> 01:52:53,833
not only this land,

1314
01:52:54,125 --> 01:52:56,245
but also the righteousness of
the people of the world!

1315
01:53:54,375 --> 01:53:55,417
You see?

1316
01:53:56,042 --> 01:53:59,625
This is what happens if you
don't submit to my country.

1317
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:41,332
Do you think that your
"eighteen subduing dragon palms",

1318
01:54:41,333 --> 01:54:43,750
is the best kung fu in the world?

1319
01:54:43,917 --> 01:54:46,250
My murong family's "star shifting",

1320
01:54:46,417 --> 01:54:48,667
which is the best martial art in the world.

1321
01:54:49,958 --> 01:54:50,958
Qiao feng!

1322
01:54:51,667 --> 01:54:55,125
Have you always had the
obsession to be a hero?

1323
01:54:56,083 --> 01:54:57,625
But what about now?

1324
01:54:57,958 --> 01:54:59,875
Your obsession is broken, right?

1325
01:55:00,042 --> 01:55:02,667
You didn't expect to end up with no family?

1326
01:55:02,708 --> 01:55:04,917
You're going to die badly!

1327
01:55:10,083 --> 01:55:12,458
If you hold on to one thought,

1328
01:55:12,958 --> 01:55:15,167
then we are trapped in one thought.

1329
01:55:15,375 --> 01:55:17,208
Letting go of one thought.

1330
01:55:17,417 --> 01:55:19,583
No distracting thoughts.

1331
01:55:20,083 --> 01:55:22,833
Only then can one become a Buddha!

1332
01:55:23,333 --> 01:55:24,375
Master,

1333
01:55:24,833 --> 01:55:26,875
why is there a low-browed bodhisattva,

1334
01:55:26,958 --> 01:55:28,458
and the vajra of angry eyes?

1335
01:55:28,792 --> 01:55:31,458
Vajra's obsession is to get rid of demons.

1336
01:55:31,708 --> 01:55:32,917
Then this obsession,

1337
01:55:33,083 --> 01:55:35,000
is it right or wrong?

1338
01:55:35,250 --> 01:55:37,167
Should we let it go?

1339
01:56:05,750 --> 01:56:06,958
Murong fu.

1340
01:56:07,250 --> 01:56:08,625
I am not a hero!

1341
01:56:09,167 --> 01:56:11,917
I'm just an ordinary person
who sticks to the right path!

1342
01:56:12,375 --> 01:56:13,500
What I want to do now is to

1343
01:56:13,625 --> 01:56:15,917
let you go to hell!

1344
01:59:01,250 --> 01:59:04,708
Your father has finally brought your mother
and zi back to dali.

1345
01:59:05,375 --> 01:59:08,250
But you know your mother
can't stand your father,

1346
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:10,125
it won't take long,

1347
01:59:11,083 --> 01:59:12,667
your mother returns to mirror lake

1348
01:59:14,125 --> 01:59:15,833
and about a zi,

1349
01:59:18,625 --> 01:59:20,167
she's a naughty girl.

1350
01:59:21,625 --> 01:59:23,417
She said she wanted to go into the world.

1351
01:59:24,542 --> 01:59:25,750
Now she's disappeared.

1352
01:59:25,833 --> 01:59:27,167
I don't know where she's gone.

1353
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:32,250
I promised

1354
01:59:33,250 --> 01:59:34,833
to bring you to seaside.

1355
01:59:35,750 --> 01:59:37,667
Now we're here.

1356
01:59:40,542 --> 01:59:42,917
Just like I told you before,

1357
01:59:45,417 --> 01:59:47,297
I'll herd the cattle and
you'll herd the sheep.

1358
01:59:48,542 --> 01:59:50,167
No longer care about the world!

1359
01:59:57,375 --> 01:59:58,917
Kingdoms across four seas,

1360
02:00:00,333 --> 02:00:02,000
a thousand autumns ten thousands years,

1361
02:00:03,875 --> 02:00:05,458
in my heart

1362
02:00:07,042 --> 02:00:08,792
I only have you, a zhu!

1363
02:01:59,875 --> 02:02:01,208
Brother-in-law!

1364
02:03:05,667 --> 02:03:06,833
Father?

1365
02:03:07,208 --> 02:03:09,042
You're still alive!

1366
02:03:11,542 --> 02:03:13,250
I have avoided the world for 30 years,

1367
02:03:13,667 --> 02:03:15,333
just to wait for the day

1368
02:03:15,792 --> 02:03:17,583
you can restore our great yan.

1369
02:03:18,167 --> 02:03:19,625
How can you be so useless?

1370
02:03:20,083 --> 02:03:21,625
I've really tried my best.

1371
02:03:21,708 --> 02:03:23,333
Father.

1372
02:03:24,167 --> 02:03:25,792
I, murong Bo, have entered the world.

1373
02:03:27,458 --> 02:03:29,375
Everything is just about to begin.

1374
02:04:01,958 --> 02:04:04,542
Yuanshan, are we almost at the yanmen pass?

1375
02:05:41,958 --> 02:05:44,042
Thank you for raising my son.

1376
02:05:44,125 --> 02:05:45,250
You are?

1377
02:05:50,292 --> 02:05:51,792
Who did it?

1378
02:05:54,542 --> 02:05:56,125
Xiao yuanshan.

1379
02:05:56,500 --> 02:05:58,958
Finally I can pay you back.

1380
02:06:29,042 --> 02:06:30,792
Xiao yuanshan.

1381
02:06:32,708 --> 02:06:34,500
Thirty years has passed.

1382
02:06:37,792 --> 02:06:40,375
You've finally shown yourself!
